    Delivery Management Systems
</h2>

<h3>
  Description:
</h3>

<p>
  The package delivery management systems loads packages, create routes, and track the statuses of the packages in a command line UI. 
</p>

<h3>
  How it works:  
</h3>

<p>
  The Delivery Management Systems takes several csv files and parses through the packages and addresses data. The data is then used to create routes using the nearest neighbor algorithm and delivery time and mileages are then tracked. 
</p>

<h3>
  Directions:
</h3>

<p>
  Users are prompted through a command line interface to check the status of all packages, a single package, or total truck mileages. Once the choice is selected, users can then designate the time periods to check for the package status.
